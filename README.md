# JavaScript-Quiz

## Introduction

This project is a little quiz that currently will randomly present a set of questions (configurable in its own javascript file). It will alert the user if the answer selected is correct or incorrect via alert screens. It will record the high score on the local storage of the client. The 'highscore' will get replaced if the score is higher than what is stored in the local storage.
